# Cloud-FinOps-Unit-Economics-Optimizing-Reddit-Scale-Infrastructure-Efficiency
Optimized Reddit-scale cloud spend by building a Unit Economics model. Managed a 48% spend increase while driving an 8.4% efficiency gain ($13.69 to $12.54 per 1k DAU). Developed a dual-axis dashboard and a Python automation script to monitor scaling margins and enforce budget guardrails.

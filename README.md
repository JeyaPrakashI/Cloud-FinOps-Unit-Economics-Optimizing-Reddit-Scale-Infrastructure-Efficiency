#🚀 Cloud FinOps & Unit Economics: Optimizing Reddit-Scale Efficiency
Executive Summary
Optimized Reddit-scale cloud spend by building a Unit Economics model. Managed a 48% spend increase while driving an 8.4% efficiency gain ($13.69 to $12.54 per 1k DAU). Developed a dual-axis dashboard and a Python automation script to monitor scaling margins and enforce budget guardrails.

📈 Strategic Visualization: The "Scissors Effect"
This chart proves that while total costs increased, the cost-to-serve each user decreased by $1.15, demonstrating massive economies of scale.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
1. Advanced Financial Modeling (Excel)
Unit Economics Dashboard: Developed a multi-variable model tracking Cloud Spend against Daily Active Users (DAU) and Pageviews.

Audit-Ready Documentation: Integrated "Formula Documentation" columns to ensure 100% transparency for financial auditors and stakeholders.

Waterfall Analysis: Quantified the specific drivers of a $170k+ monthly spend variance.

2. Automated Guardrails (Python)
I developed a proprietary engine to automate the detection of "Inefficient Scaling." This script ensures that if the unit cost exceeds the $14.00 efficiency threshold, an alert is triggered.
